net.juckel.osgijrubytest
========================

Simple test app for running JRuby under OSGi and test classloading issues.
For now, you must place a JRuby jar within extensions/plugins, set the 
target platform from the platform.target file, then run the
net.juckel.osgijrubytest.id1 application.

Yes, I should make this a simple Pax Runner test or some such...
